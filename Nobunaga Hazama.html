            <p class="styled-text" style="margin: 15px;">Nobunaga Hazama, a loyal and hot-headed member of the Phantom Troupe, is a master swordsman with a deep sense of camaraderie for his fellow Spiders. As an Enhancer, Nobunaga specializes in close combat, wielding his katana with incredible speed and precision. His straightforward and impulsive nature often contrasts with the more calculated members of the Troupe, but his dedication to the group is unwavering. While Nobunaga’s fights are rarely showcased in detail, one notable encounter involves his confrontation with Owl, also known as Odi, during the Yorknew City arc. Odi, a member of the Shadow Beasts, uses his Fun Fun Cloth ability to trap and immobilize his enemies. However, Nobunaga’s quick reflexes and combat instincts allow him to evade Odi’s attacks and ultimately turn the tables. This brief but intense skirmish highlights Nobunaga’s skill as a swordsman and his ability to adapt to unexpected challenges, further solidifying his role as a key fighter within the Phantom Troupe.</p>
